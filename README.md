# Clothware.io
Turn 2D images of clothing into usable 3D objects. Use API to automate your clothing design, character design or integrate into your e-commerce solution.

DEMO API / DOCS: https://84fb-184-105-175-12.ngrok.io/docs#/default/upload_upload_post

## How it works 

Using API, make POST call with front & back images of T-shirt or pants. Specify type in form as 'shirt' or 'pants". 
If call is successful, you will recieve the generated 3D object. 
Drag the artifacts into an object viewer, such as https://3dviewer.net/ and export the model. 
You can also manipulate the texture.png file in any photo editor to refine the look and design of the garment.

## Examples

You can test the API with front(odd) & back (even) image files found in the 'input' folder of this repo. You can view example generated 3d objects by downloading an output zip file found in the 'output' folder of this repo
