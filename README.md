## How it works 

Using API, make POST call with front & back images of T-shirt or pants. Specify type in form as 'shirt' or 'pants". 
If call is successful, you will recieve the generated 3D object. 
Drag the artifacts into an object viewer, such as https://3dviewer.net/ and export the model. 
You can also manipulate the texture.png file in any photo editor to refine the look and design of the garment.
